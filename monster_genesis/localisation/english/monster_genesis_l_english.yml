The project involves the cultivation of tissues of space-born organics for the creation of artificial life. In other words, our scientists, at the cost of considerable effort, propose to create a being on a truly cosmic scale."
monster_genesis.2.desc.1:"Painstaking work in the branches of §Ggenetics§! and §Gbioprojection§! is beginning to yield results. With the permission of the great §H[Root.GetRulerTitle]§! the leading biologist of the planet §H[Root.Capital.GetName]§! conducted research on the genome of space giants, namely the sample §RNLO.14§!, better known under the pseudonym §NTiyanki§! After collecting a colossal amount of data, he offered to fund a project called §H$tech_ark_of_genesis$§! It's about the process of creating artificial space life. In layman's terms, we are offered to learn how to breed space whales."
monster_genesis.2.desc.2:"The latest research in the fields of §Ggenetics§! and §Gbioprojection§! is paying off. You've probably heard of creatures called §NTiyanki§!. These organic members of the sparse space fauna are quite peaceful, which allows us to study them with care. We've spent many months collecting primary data, and now we're rushing to offer you funding for a project called §H$tech_ark_of_genesis$§! Its main task will be genetic manipulation to form an artificial space whale. Successful practical research will allow us to significantly advance in the biological sciences, as well as give us the opportunity to assemble our own space herd."
monster_genesis.2.desc.3:"We hasten to give you a report on cutting-edge research in the branches of §Ggenetics§! and §Gbioprojection§! For individual papers by professors of biological sciences... there's a long list of names... it is difficult to imagine what exactly this, by the way not cheap, scientific department was doing, but if we combine these studies into a single set - we get, not to dare to say it, a real scientific breakthrough. Using the genetic tools of the Imperial Research Institute, we were able to isolate sections of the space whale deoxyribonucleic acid molecule responsible for accelerating cell growth. Without going into too much detail, the scientific community of §Ggreen division§! humbly asks you to fund the creation of a university to study and cultivate space organics and launch an imperial national project called §H$tech_ark_of_genesis$§!"
monster_genesis.2.desc.4:"At first glance, a very ordinary report from an imperial §Gbiological§! research laboratory turns into a very entertaining and even somewhat intriguing read. A number of scientists in the lab experimented with the genetic markers of various creatures, including space-born organisms, and obtained astonishing results. The cell growth rate of creatures called §NTiyanki§! can be manipulated in a very sensitive range. Such research could give life to a new milestone in our history, and in the long term could bring our empire's animal husbandry to a new, cosmic, level. Further study of the influence on the genome will, in theory, even allow for the introduction of behavioral patterns at instinct levels, allowing for limited control over formed creatures. All of the above calls for the establishment of a new national institute to promote such research."
